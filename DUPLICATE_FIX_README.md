# Duplicate Product Creation Fix

This fix addresses the critical issue where duplicate products were being created in the database during user login, page refresh, and other scenarios.

## What Was Fixed

### Root Causes Identified:
1. **Database Schema**: No unique constraint on `(user_id, name)` allowing duplicate products
2. **React StrictMode**: Double execution of useEffect in development mode
3. **Migration Tracking**: localStorage-based tracking was unreliable across devices/sessions
4. **Race Conditions**: Multiple simultaneous initialization calls
5. **useEffect Dependencies**: Incorrect dependencies causing re-execution

### Changes Made:

#### Database Level:
- Added `UNIQUE(user_id, name)` constraint to prevent duplicate products per user
- Created `user_initialization` table for robust tracking of initialization status
- Added proper error handling for constraint violations

#### Application Level:
- Enhanced duplicate detection before product creation
- Implemented database-backed initialization tracking
- Fixed React useEffect dependencies and double execution prevention
- Added proper async operation cancellation

## How to Apply the Fix

### For New Installations:
1. Use the updated `database/schema.sql` which includes all the fixes
2. Deploy the updated application code

### For Existing Installations:

#### Step 1: Apply Database Migration
Run the migration script in your Supabase SQL editor:
```sql
-- Run the contents of database/migration-duplicate-fix.sql
```

#### Step 2: Handle Existing Duplicates (if any)
If the unique constraint creation fails due to existing duplicates:

1. **Check for duplicates:**
```sql
SELECT user_id, name, COUNT(*) as duplicate_count
FROM public.products
GROUP BY user_id, name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY user_id, name;
```

2. **Clean up duplicates (keeps oldest):**
```sql
WITH duplicates AS (
    SELECT id,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY user_id, name ORDER BY created_at ASC) as rn
    FROM public.products
)
DELETE FROM public.products
WHERE id IN (
    SELECT id FROM duplicates WHERE rn > 1
);
```

3. **Add the constraint:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE public.products ADD CONSTRAINT products_user_name_unique UNIQUE (user_id, name);
```

#### Step 3: Deploy Application Code
Deploy the updated application code to your hosting platform.

## Verification

After applying the fix, verify it's working:

1. **Check database constraints:**
```sql
SELECT conname FROM pg_constraint WHERE conname = 'products_user_name_unique';
```

2. **Check initialization tracking:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.user_initialization;
```

3. **Verify no duplicates exist:**
```sql
SELECT user_id, name, COUNT(*) as count
FROM public.products
GROUP BY user_id, name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

## Testing the Fix

The fix prevents duplicates in all scenarios:

1. **Fresh user login** - Products initialized exactly once
2. **Page refresh** - No additional products created
3. **Multiple tabs** - Concurrent access handled safely
4. **React StrictMode** - Development double execution handled
5. **Migration reruns** - Idempotent operations

## Technical Details

### Database Schema Changes:
- `products` table: Added `UNIQUE(user_id, name)` constraint
- New `user_initialization` table with columns:
  - `user_id` (Primary Key)
  - `products_initialized` (Boolean)
  - `migration_completed` (Boolean)
  - Timestamps and RLS policies

### Application Logic Changes:
- Enhanced `createProduct()` with proper constraint handling
- Rewritten `initializeDefaultProducts()` with robust duplicate prevention  
- Database-backed migration tracking instead of localStorage
- Fixed useEffect dependencies to prevent unnecessary re-execution
- Added proper async operation cancellation and race condition protection

### Error Handling:
- Graceful handling of unique constraint violations
- Fallback mechanisms for edge cases
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

## Compatibility

- ✅ Backwards compatible with existing data
- ✅ No breaking changes to API
- ✅ Preserves all existing functionality
- ✅ Safe to apply to production databases

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the migration logs in Supabase SQL editor
2. Verify all constraints were created successfully
3. Run the verification queries provided
4. Check browser console for any application errors

The fix has been thoroughly tested and should resolve all duplicate product creation scenarios.
